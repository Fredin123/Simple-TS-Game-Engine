# Simple-TS-Game-Engine
This is an attempt to create a general purpose 2d game engine with typescript. (Currently I'm working on making the movement and collision smooth with moving platforms)


Currently the projects exists of two parts:
The engine and the room creator.

They are built with:
    npm run build

To serve the project you run the nodejs server using:
    node simpleServer.js
